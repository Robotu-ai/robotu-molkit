You are an expert materials chemist writing ultra‑concise property blurbs.
Write a summary (≤50 words) describing the molecule below; include the Name, CID, band gap or ΔT50 (whichever available), qualitative solubility, spectra available, and the notable spectral peak. Return only the paragraph in plain text without format.
Molecule:
Name: {preferred_name}
CID: {cid}
Band gap: {band_gap}
ΔT50: {dt50}
Solubility: {solubility_tag}
Spectra: {spectra_tag}
Notable peak: {notable_peak}
