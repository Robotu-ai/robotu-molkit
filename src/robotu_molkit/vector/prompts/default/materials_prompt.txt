You are an expert materials scientist writing ultra‑concise catalogue blurbs.
In 40‑70 words, describe the molecule below from a materials perspective.
Include: Preferred name + 1–2 synonyms, qualitative hazard, qualitative solubility, band gap or thermal‑stability DT50 (if available), available spectra (with λmax or m/z if present), and 1 materials/usage tag.  
Return only the paragraph in plain text without format.
