## 🌟 What is RobotU Molkit?

**RobotU Molkit** is an open-source Python toolkit that enables:

- 🧪 **Fetching and structuring** chemical data directly from PubChem.
- 🧠 **Enriching molecules** using IBM’s Granite AI models for semantic insight.
- 🔎 **Running semantic and structural searches** locally via FAISS—fast, offline, and precise.
- 📌 **Delivering meaningful results**, combining natural-language queries with structural filters.

## 🚀 Why Molkit?

- **Natural-language chemistry**: Ask questions in plain English—no specialized query syntax needed.
- **Semantic intelligence**: Go beyond strings and atoms—Molkit understands chemical context.
- **Quantum-ready integration**: Built to evolve with Qiskit and Qiskit Nature for future simulations.

Imagine navigating chemical space as naturally as **Shuri in Wakanda** manipulating molecular holograms. With RobotU Molkit, that vision moves from fiction to function.
