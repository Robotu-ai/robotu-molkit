# 🤖 Welcome to RobotU Molkit

**RobotU Molkit** is your gateway to the next generation of AI-powered chemical discovery. Built on cutting-edge technology from IBM, Molkit simplifies how chemists and chemical engineers search, explore, and simulate molecules—making complex chemistry intuitive and accessible.

---

### 🌟 What is RobotU Molkit?

RobotU Molkit is an open-source Python library designed to:

- 🧪 **Fetch and structure** chemical data directly from PubChem.
- 🧠 **Enrich** molecules using IBM’s Granite AI models, embedding semantic understanding into chemical exploration.
- 🔎 **Run semantic and structural searches** locally with FAISS—fast, offline, and precise.
- 📌 **Provide meaningful results**, combining natural-language queries and structural constraints seamlessly.

---

### 🚀 Why Molkit?

- **Natural-language chemistry**: Ask questions in plain language—no more complex query languages.
- **Semantic intelligence**: Go beyond text and structure; Molkit understands chemical concepts.
- **Quantum-ready vision**: The first step toward quantum simulations using libraries like Qiskit and Qiskit Nature.

Imagine exploring chemistry as naturally as **Shuri from Wakanda** interacting with molecular holograms. With RobotU Molkit, we're bringing that vision closer to reality—making sophisticated molecule exploration easy, interactive, and intuitive.
